SceneHub is a work-in-progress app framework for viewing and editing SceneGraph objects.
This is in an early 'alpha' state and can serve as an example or for testing.

The following operations are supported:

Tree view:

- generated instances will be created as branches are expanded
- selection will be reflected in the 3D view, enabling the transform manipulator
- with an item selected, right-clicking will open a contextual menu to expand or load recursively

3D view:

- partially loaded assets are shown as bounding boxes (if at least one of the child isn't loaded)

- hold 'Alt' key to navigate the camera:

- click & drag: orbit
- middle-click & drag: pan
- wheel or right-click & drag: zoom
- arrow keys to orbit and zoom

- click on a geometry to select it. This will activate the transform tool:

- press S, R, T to change transform mode (might need to first click in the 3D view)
- click & drag the gizmos to change the transform

- With a selected geometry, right-click to have a contextual menu for:

- light: changing the color or intensity
- geometry: setting the color (shared), local color (instance specific) or texture
- parent: setting the color (propagated to children)

- click in the background to un-select. Then, right-click to have a contextual menu for:

- adding a geometry from a file (Fbx, Alembic)
- creating a light

- drag & drop to the 3D view:

- Fbx or Alembic file:
  - adds the asset as a child of the 'root'
  - bounding box'es bottom placed under mouse's cursor (raycast)
  - assets dropped multiple times share their content in the SceneGraph (load once)
  - if holding `Ctrl` key: will load recursively (expand)

- Image file:
  - set as a textured color if dropped on a geometry with UVs
  - images dropped multiple times share their content in the SceneGraph (load once)
  - if holding `Ctrl` key: will set as a local texture (instance specific)
